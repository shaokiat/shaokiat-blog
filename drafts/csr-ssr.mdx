# NextJS Client-side vs Server-side

:::

## Server-side rendering

These 3 methods will only be running on the server-side. Allowing us to fetch data directly in pages instead of from the `api` folder.
The code will not be sent to the client-side.

`getStaticProps`(Satic Generation): Fetch data at build time.

`getStaticPaths`(Static Generation): Specify dynamic routes to pre-render based on data.

`getServerSideProps`(Server-side rendering): Fetch data on each request.

### `getStaticProps`(Satic Generation)

Make database call upon building. Get data and render it once and make information `static`.
No continuous call to backend database. Refreshing page does not fetch data from database.

When to use:

-

`unstable_revalidate: [seconds]`: re-fetch data every `seconds` and update data.

### `getStaticPaths`(Static Generation)

Tells NextJS which **dynamic routes** to pre-load and pre-create pages for.

`fallback: [boolean]`: In the background, Next.js will statically generate the requested path HTML and JSON. This includes running `getStaticProps`.

### `getServerSideProps`(Server-side rendering)

When to use:

- Every refresh of the page will call `getServerSideProps`.
- To be used on pages that require data to be fetched before rendering.

When not to use:

- Pages that does not require call to database.
- Data that does not change often.
