# Cookie vs Local Storage

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3220660/local-storage-vs-cookies

## Cookies

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies

An HTTP cookie is a small piece of data that a server sends to a user's web browser. The browser may store
the cookie and send it back to the same server with later requests.

Typically, this cookie is used to tell if two requests came from the same browser, keeping a user logged in.
This way, it remembers stateful information for the stateless HTTP protocol. - MDN Web Docs

Cookies are sent with every request, which can worsen performance. Modern APIs for client storage (localStorage and sessionStorage) are instead
recommended for this use case.

- Cookies are primarily for reading server-side
- Cookies have a limit of 4096 bytes per cookie
- Cookies have expiration date

Local storage can only be read by the client-side

- as big as 5MB per domain
- localStorage is an implementation of the Storage Interface -> stores data with no expiration date
