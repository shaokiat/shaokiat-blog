This is a recount of an experience during my exchange at UC Santa Cruz, that has left me thinking about the stark difference in culture of the US to that of my home country, Singapore.

I had embarked on a backpacking trip with the school's recreation club to Big Sur, headed by two amazing student guides. I was joined by my buddy, Vincent, whom I had became good friends with
prior to the trip. We were all thrilled to be part of the expedition and the drive was long but scenic, with breathtaking views of the Pacific Ocean
and towering cliffs that hugged the coastline.

We began our hike into Big Sur and and eventually to Buckeye Camp where we would settle down for the night.

We were extremely lucky that night to experience the most surreal star gazing experience upon the clear, crisp night, along with camping games
that filled the air with laughter and joy. Being able to see the Milky Way with my naked eye was a humbling experience that has left me questioning
my own existence. Every corner of the sky were lit up with countless stars, a scene that would have never existed in Singapore.

### The Incident

While we were left to our own stations to settle down for the night, my buddy Vincent, decided to roll a joint. Some essential background information is that while
weed is legal in California, it is not legal according to the Federal laws, which still governs State parks and school trips as they receive federal fundings.
As he was about done with the joint, the two student guides found out about it and were furious, stating that this is the first time they had someone smoke on an
expedition. They explained that they were angry as they might lose their jobs, and it was a dangerous fire hazard, especially during the dry Fall season that we are in
right now.

The two guides then said that they were going to confiscate his 'apparatus' and hand it over to the head of the recreation club. This incident ruined the happy moment
and the mood got really awkward the following morning as we began our hike back.

### Face the Music

A week later, I met Vincent and what he told me was something that I would never have expected. He said that he met the head of the recreation club to discuss about the smoking
incident, and what was shocking was that instead of giving him a harsh punishment, the head actually apologized on behalf of his student guides for
confiscating his things without permission, and returned his things back to him. In the end, Vincent got let off with a just warning not to do it again.

### Stark Differences

The resolution for this incident left me thinking about the stark difference in cultures, and that how much the Americans value privacy as well as mutual respect. This would
have only been possible if the person of authority respects the people under him to do the right thing and learn from their mistakes.

From where I came from, it is ingrained in me that incidents like these would have been dealt with the heaviest punishment. We were taught never to question authority,
and people with authority usually gets away with anything they do.

Now, I am not saying that the resolution is right or wrong, just that it would have never cross my mind that such a resolution is even possible.
This has definitely expanded my horizon as to how people from different cultures deal with conflicts, and there are definitely learning points from this incident.
