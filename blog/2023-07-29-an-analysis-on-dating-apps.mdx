## Preamble

As I began my work as a data scientist, I thought, why not try to analyze some data from my own real-world experiences?

And what dataset could be more interesting than my own dating app experience? So for the month of July 2023, I began tracking
the statistics of my experience with dating apps in Singapore as a 25-year-old male and as a free user.

## Part I: The Game of Swipes

First of all, we should all understand the phenomenon of the dating app scene. I happened to chance upon this fantastic video that explains the situation with such accuracy, using models and assumptions‚Äîa language spoken by data scientists and statisticians.

Please give the video a watch before continuing, and I will be summarizing the learning points from this video and my observations from it as well.

### Why are men getting fewer matches?

The median number of matches for men is skewed by the imbalance of several factors:

1. Significantly more men than women uses dating apps (Gender imbalance)
2. Men give more likes than women (Engagement bias)
3. A small share of users get a big share of the likes (Engagement imbalance)

### What is the result of these?

:::tip Men
As men don't get as many likes, they start giving likes more generously to improve their chances of getting matched.

Studies indicate that dating apps can have a negative impact on self-esteem, with a stronger effect on men.

:::info Women

Women are overwhelmed with choices, making them think more carefully about who they give likes to, and since guys are so
generous with their likes, there is a good chance he is not even genuinely interested.

Women often have to find strategies to deal with intrusive behavior from men.

### What's My Strategy?

As I believe I do not belong in the top 15%, I naturally applied the strategy mentioned above. And this means that in order to acquire more matches,
I need to invest additional time in optimizing a good dating profile and be more generous with my likes.

## Part II: Match Statistics

Below is a Sankey Chart of the statistics for the month of July 2023.

### What could be optimized?

From the observation of the chart,

30% of matches did not end up with any messages at all. And since I have to start the conversations the majority of the time, perhaps I could be more careful and less generous with my likes.

27% of matches that did have messages never replied, possibly indicating that I should look into working on my opening message.

#### Pie Chart of Dating App Statistics

</div>
<br />

Statistically, OKC has the worst Match-to-Conversation ratio of only 21.4%, and this means that it is the worst platform out of the
three for me. In my opinion, this is also congruent to the experience that I had in terms of user experience and quality of matches.

### Limitations

This chart is limited in information from which to draw conclusions and only offers a big-picture view of the statistics.
The chart does not tell me about the quality of the matches on each platform, and there could potentially be a data imbalance present in each app, possibly due to the different demographics of the users.

A more detailed approach could be used to include factors such as user feedback, satisfaction ratings, success stories, or user demographics. These additional data points could then provide some insight into the respective dating apps.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, keeping track of the data from personal experiences is indeed an interesting way to gain insights into my own preferences, patterns, and experiences. This self-reflection can hopefully lead to enhanced decision-making and, ultimately, an increased likelihood of finding a potential partner.

This is definitely a good experiment to get me more proactive and mindful about the data that surrounds me in the digital landscape as I continue to explore and understand the broader implications of data in my life.
