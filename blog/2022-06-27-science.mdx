In this blog post, I want to discuss about a topic that I am deeply passionate about. I have always been a big fan of Science, constantly
intrigued by how things work, and frequently fascinated by new scientific discoveries. In fact, a person that I really looked up to is none other
than Elon Musk, not because of his riches, but his passion in tackling the hardest problems and playing a major role in advancing the Human race.

Why I believe the scientific method should be the standard to establish ideas.

### What is the [Scientific Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method)?

### What is a Scientific Theory?

A scientific theory is a well-confirmed framework of ideas that explains (or describes) what we observe.

Scientific ideas are never absolutely certain. How can we even be absolutely certain about anything? Our brain also has its fair share of flaws.
What we can only do is to establish the best possible theory at that point in time.

No scientific theory, no matter how strongly supported by
available evidence, is final and unchallengeable; any good
theory is always exposed to the possibility of being modified or
even overthrown by new evidence. That is at the very heart of
the process of science.

A scientific theory seeks to be disproved and this is what makes it so great. Always adaptable to changes and better ideas.
A process that we should also constantly emulate in our lives.

### Why then?

Perhaps what inspired me to write this blog post is the notion that people readily accepts ideas that cannot be challenged. And that important decisions
and laws are made based on these ideas. How then are we, as a society, supposed to advance?
