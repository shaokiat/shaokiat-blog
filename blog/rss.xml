            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This marks the start of my very first blog post and the start of my journey to reach for greater heights.
I want to pen down my thoughts through my job search journey as a software engineer and whoever is reading this (yes that&#x27;s you :flushed:) will
serve as witness and reminder for me to hold myself accountable :bulb:.</p><h3>About me</h3><p>As of writing this blog post, I am in my third year of NUS, majoring in Computer Science.</p><h3>Goals</h3><ul><li>Securing a 2022 Summer Internship at a <a href="http://elijames.org/the-two-tiers-of-singapores-tech-companies/">Good</a> company</li><li>Overseas Exchange at University of California</li><li>Securing job at a <a href="http://elijames.org/the-two-tiers-of-singapores-tech-companies/">Good</a> company (SV/SG)</li></ul><p>I had just received an offer to exchange at University of California, a dream come true, yet at the same time feeling uneasy.
Things hasn&#x27;t been easy with my internship search and I am beginning to doubt my ability as a SWE.</p>]]></content:encoded>
