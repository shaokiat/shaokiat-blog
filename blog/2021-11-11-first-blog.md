This marks the start of my very first blog post and the start of my journey to reach for greater heights.
I want to pen down my thoughts through my job search journey as a software engineer and whoever is reading this (yes that's you :flushed:) will
serve as witness and reminder for me to hold myself accountable :bulb:.

### About me

As of writing this blog post, I am in my third year of NUS, majoring in Computer Science.

### Goals

- Securing a 2022 Summer Internship at a [Good](http://elijames.org/the-two-tiers-of-singapores-tech-companies/) company
- Overseas Exchange at University of California
- Securing job at a [Good](http://elijames.org/the-two-tiers-of-singapores-tech-companies/) company (SV/SG)

I had just received an offer to exchange at University of California, a dream come true, yet at the same time feeling uneasy.
Things hasn't been easy with my internship search and I am beginning to doubt my ability as a SWE.
