# Why I chose Docusaurus

![alt](/img/logo.svg)

## Purpose

Let me first explain my thought process and purpose behind creating this blog. The purpose of my blog is for me to pen down my
learning journey as an aspiring software engineer. Consolidating and typing down useful programming ideas can be a good way for me to
internalize everything I have learned. Besides, I also hope that the articles I would be writing (hopefully) can be of good use to
anyone reading this (yes that's you), just like how I have benefitted greatly from the various blogs I have came across.

## Criteria I have in mind

- Good SEO
- Built upon ReactJS
- Easy to start

Initially, my plan was to create a simple React app that can render Markdown files easily so as to ease the process of creating
the blog. However, the [Archiles' Heel for React app](https://www.toptal.com/react/react-seo-best-practices) is its
[Search Engine Optimization](https://moz.com/beginners-guide-to-seo) which I will go into further details in future.

However, soon I chanced upon my soulmate, the perfect partner that makes all your worries go away.
