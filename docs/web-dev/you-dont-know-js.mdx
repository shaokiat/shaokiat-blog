# You-Dont-Know-JS

I am diving deeper into JS and want to share my learning points from the beautifully written book on JS.

**JavaScript's Multi-Paradigms**

- Procedural style: Top-down, linear progression through pre-determined set of operations.

- Object Oriented style: Organize code by collecting logic and data together into units called classes.
- Functional Programming style: Organizes code into functions, and the adaptations of those functions as values.

### Backwards Compatability

One major JS foundational principle is the preservation of backwards compatibility.

:::important Backward compatibility
Any code written previously should still be working in today's JS engine.

AKA: _Old code able to run in new engine_.
:::

:::tip forward compatibility
Being forward-compatible means that including a new feature to the language in a program will not cause the program to break if
it was running in an older JS engine.

AKA: _Old engine able to run new code_. <br/>
Examples: `HTML`, `CSS`
:::

**Solutions for forward compatibility**

[**Transpiler**](https://scotch.io/tutorials/javascript-transpilers-what-they-are-why-we-need-them): A special software to translate source code of a program from one form to another.

For example, [`Babel`](https://babeljs.io/) converts newer JS syntax version to an equivalent older syntax.

[**Polyfill**](https://javascript.info/polyfills#polyfills): A script that updates and adds new or missing implementations to old JS engines.

### Each JS File is a Program

**Error Handling**

Since JS Files are treated as programs, failing to process one file would not necessarily prevent the next file from
being processed.

:::note Note
Many projects use build process tools that end up combining separate files into a single JS file, allowing
the file to be treated as a single program. (Does React do this?)
:::

**How does multiple standalone JS file act as a single program?** <br/>
By sharing state via the "global scope".

**Module**: A collection of state and publicly exposed methods to operate on that state <br/>
Importing a module into another allows runtime interoperation between them

<br />

### Equality in JS

:::tip
Be sure to check out an excellent blog article by a good friend of mine on this topic of Equality.<br/>
[**Where is the Equality in JavaScript?**](https://siawsam.wordpress.com/2020/08/16/equality-in-javascript/)
:::

**Structural Equality** vs **Identity Equality**

For object values, JS define `===` as identity equality instead of structural equality.
In JS, all object values are held by reference, assigned and passed by reference-copy.

<!-- TODO Elaborate on Values vs Reference -->

:::important Identity Equality
Identity determines whether two objects share the same memory address. (Comparison of reference to address)
:::

Structural equality comparison on the other hand, has to be manually configured and is tedious to implement its checks.

:::note Structural equality
How to determine if two functions are "structurally equivalent"? How to take into consideration scoping and closure?
:::

<br />

**Coercive Comparison**

:::caution Avoid
"Loose equality" operator `==`
:::

Between same value type, `==` behaves the same way as `===`. Prefers numerical comparison.

Consider:

```js
27 == "27"; // True
1 == true; // True

"" == 0; //True
0 == false; //True
```

In the cases above, the value types are different and the generally non-numerical value types are coverted to numbers before comparison is made. <br/>
[See also: why](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7605011/why-is-0-true-in-javascript) `"" == 0` is True.
