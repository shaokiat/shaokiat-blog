# You-Dont-Know-JS

I am diving deeper into JS and want to share my learning points from the beautifully written book on JS.

**JavaScript's Multi-Paradigms**

- Procedural style: Top-down, linear progression through pre-determined set of operations.

- Object Oriented style: Organize code by collecting logic and data together into units called classes.
- Functional Programming style: Organizes code into functions, and the adaptations of those functions as values.

<br />

### Backwards Compatability

One major JS foundational principle is the preservation of backwards compatibility.

:::important Backward compatibility
Any code written previously should still be working in today's JS engine.

AKA: _Old code able to run in new engine_.
:::

:::tip forward compatibility
Being forward-compatible means that including a new feature to the language in a program will not cause the program to break if
it was running in an older JS engine.

AKA: _Old engine able to run new code_. <br/>
Examples: `HTML`, `CSS`
:::

**Solutions for forward compatibility**

[**Transpiler**](https://scotch.io/tutorials/javascript-transpilers-what-they-are-why-we-need-them): A special software to translate source code of a program from one form to another.

For example, [`Babel`](https://babeljs.io/) converts newer JS syntax version to an equivalent older syntax.

[**Polyfill**](https://javascript.info/polyfills#polyfills): A script that updates and adds new or missing implementations to old JS engines.

<br />

### Strict Mode

[Strict mode](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Strict_mode) was introduced with the release of ES5, to encourage better JS programs.

- Prohibits function statements that are not at the top level of a script or function.

[Some examples](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/strict-mode-javascript/) of strict mode usage from geeksforgeeks.

Enabling strict mode:

```js
// comments and whitespaces allowed only
"use strict";
// program
```

Due to [backwards compatibility](#backwards-compatability), JS will almost never enforce strict mode as it might break old JS code written.
However, most production code has been transpiled to adhere to strict mode and ES6 modules assume strict mode.

### Each JS File is a Program

**Error Handling**

Since JS Files are treated as programs, failing to process one file would not necessarily prevent the next file from
being processed.

:::note Note
Many projects use build process tools that end up combining separate files into a single JS file, allowing
the file to be treated as a single program. (Does React do this?)
:::

**How does multiple standalone JS file act as a single program?** <br/>
By sharing state via the "global scope".

**Module**: A collection of state and publicly exposed methods to operate on that state <br/>
Importing a module into another allows runtime interoperation between them

### Variables Declaration

#### `var`

Regular or function scoping: Hoisted to the global/function lexical environment and accessible in the global/function scope.

#### `let` and `const`

Block scoping: Allows a more limited access to the variable - only available in the block scope.

- `let`: Can be reassigned a value
- `const`: Must be given a value during declaration and cannot be re-assigned.

#### Syntax that declares variables

Function parameters are declared as `var` type as it is a function-scoped variable.

```js
function hello(variable) {
  console.log(`this is a var type: ${variable}`);
}

hello("var");
// this is a var type: var
```

`catch` clause are declared as `let` type as it is a block-scoped variable.

```js
try {
  someCode();
} catch (err) {
  console.log(`this is a let type: ${err}`);
}
```

### Functions

In JS, functions are closely related to "procedures" - a collection of statements that can be invoked one or more times.

Usual function declaration: (global object)

```js
function normalFunc(input) {
  // ...
  return input;
}
```

In JS, functions are values that can be assigned to variables as such:

```js
const myFunction = function (input) {
  // ...
  return input;
};

let myFunc = (input) => {
  // ...
  return input;
};
```

### Equality in JS

:::tip
Be sure to check out an excellent blog article by a good friend of mine on this topic of Equality.<br/>
[**Where is the Equality in JavaScript?**](https://siawsam.wordpress.com/2020/08/16/equality-in-javascript/)
:::

**Structural Equality** vs **Identity Equality**

For object values, JS define `===` as identity equality instead of structural equality.
In JS, all object values are held by reference, assigned and passed by reference-copy.

<!-- TODO Elaborate on Values vs Reference -->

:::important Identity Equality
Identity determines whether two objects share the same memory address. (Comparison of reference to address)
:::

Structural equality comparison on the other hand, has to be manually configured and is tedious to implement its checks.

:::note Structural equality
How to determine if two functions are "structurally equivalent"? How to take into consideration scoping and closure?
:::

<br />

**Coercive Comparison**

:::caution Avoid
Avoid using "Loose equality" operator `==`.

Always use `===` for equality comparison.
:::

Between same value type, `==` behaves the same way as `===`. Prefers numerical comparison.

Consider:

```js
27 == "27"; // True
1 == true; // True

"" == 0; //True
0 == false; //True
```

In the cases above, the value types are different and the generally non-numerical value types are **coverted to numbers** before comparison is made.

[See also: ](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7605011/why-is-0-true-in-javascript) why `"" == 0` is True.

### Classes vs Modules
