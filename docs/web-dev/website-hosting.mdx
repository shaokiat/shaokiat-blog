# Portfolio Website Hosting Guide

In this guide, I will walk you through my personal experience and tools I used for my own personal portfolio page.

As a Singaporean, it is without a doubt that I will sail the seven seas just to find the cheapest way (free) to do something.
In this case, I have found a way to obtain free domain name and host it for free on Heroku.

Disclaimer: This guide is accurate as of <u>27 Dec 2021</u> and the tools I used might not be available by the time you read this.

## Free Hosting on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)

My portfolio page is created using [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) and these are the steps to host a React App on Heroku.

Steps:

1. Create an account on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)
2. Connect your Github account to Heroku
3. Add [React Buildpack](https://github.com/mars/create-react-app-buildpack) to Heroku as the default is NodeJS Buildpack

`https://github.com/mars/create-react-app-buildpack`

    width="1000"
  />
</div>
4. Choose the branch you want to deploy and enable automatic deployment

:::caution
Heroku has implemented a feature to prevent abuse of its platform called [**Dyno Hours**](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/free-dyno-hours).
Active apps on your heroku account will consume dyno hours and on the free plan, apps with no web traffic in a 30-minute period will go to **sleep**.
:::

This is **not desirable** for a portfolio page as your potential recruiters may look up your website at any point in time and they are going
to be real disappointed if your website takes about a minute to load. Personally, I only have patience of about 5 seconds waiting for a page to load up
before thinking that the website is laggy.

Personal accounts with credit card verification will received **1000 free dyno hours** each month.
If you only have one app running for all 30 days of the month -> 30 \* 24 hours = **720 hours**. Which means that we can let our app run
for the entire month and we have to find a way to prevent it from sleeping.

:::info Solution
[New Relic add-on](http://addons.heroku.com/newrelic) on Heroku to send ping to your domain every 30 minutes and this will keep your app from sleeping.
You can also explore this add-on for some additional monitoring information.

## Free Domain Name

:::tip
[**Freenom**](https://www.freenom.com/en/index.html?lang=en) is the site I used to get my free domain name -
[shaokiat.xyz](https://shaokiat.xyz)

Check out this [**video guide**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8vt8E4qCo) to get your custom domain from Freenom.
:::

Steps:

1. Create an account on Freenom and search for the domain name that you want that is available on freenom
2. Once you have obtained your free domain name on Freenom, add this custom domain to your Heroku app as shown below

<div style={{ textAlign: "center" }}>
  <img
    src="/shaokiat-blog/img/web-dev/heroku-domains.png"
    alt=""
    width="1000"
  />
</div>

:::note
Do not worry about the DNS Management over at your Freenom account for now as we will configure that later on with our SSL
certificate on Cloudflare.
:::

## Free SSL Certificate

:::note
Some in-built browsers only allows access to secure websites with SSL certificate which are websites that begins with `https://`
instead of `http://` so it is crucial that we add SSL certificate to our website.
:::

:::tip
[**Cloudflare**](https://www.cloudflare.com/) provides free SSL certificate for life!

Check out this [**video guide**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4iHXhRkpO4) for the configuration of your website.
:::

Steps:

1. Create a Cloudflare account and add your custom domain
2. Add the Cloudflare nameservers **assigned** to you to the custom nameservers in your Freenom account as shown below

<div style={{ textAlign: "center" }}>
  <img src="/shaokiat-blog/img/web-dev/nameservers.png" alt="" width="1000" />
</div>

3. Select `Always Use HTTPS` and we are done!

Great job!! You have now hosted your website on your own custom domain! ðŸ¥³ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰
