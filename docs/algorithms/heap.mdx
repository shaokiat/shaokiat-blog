#### Solution 1: Math Approach
- Case 1: No idle gaps required - answer is length of tasks
- Case 2: Idle gaps required - (maxFreq - 1) * (n + 1) + nMax
  - (maxFreq - 1) - maximum occurences of character with maximum occurences except last occurence
  - (n + 1) - number of elements in each repeated interval `A _ _`
  - nMax - number of characters in last occurence
 
```py
def leastInterval(self, tasks, n):
  store = {}
  for i in tasks:
    store = 1 + store.get(i, 0) # default 0 if not found
  lst = sorted(store.values(), reverse=True)
  maxFreq = lst[0]
  nMax = lst.count(maxFreq)
  caseTwo = (maxFreq - 1) * (n + 1) + nMax
  return max(len(tasks), caseTwo)
```

Time Complexity: `O(n)` for counting tasks.

Space Complexity: `O(1)` for fixed dictionary size of 26 characters.

#### Solution 2: Heap and Queue

```py
def leastInterval(self, tasks, n):
  count = Counter(tasks)
  maxHeap = [-cnt for cnt in count.values()]
  heapq.heapify(maxHeap)
  
  time = 0 
  q = deque() # pairs of [-cnt, idleTime]
  while maxHeap or q:
    time += 1
    if maxHeap:
      cnt = 1 + heapq.heappop(maxHeap)
      if cnt: # Count not zero: add back to queue with new idleTime
        q.append([cnt, time + n])
    if q and q[0][1] == time:
      heapq.heappush(maxHeap, q.popleft()[0])
  return time
```

Time Complexity: `O(n + m)` where n is len(tasks) and m is length of idle interval.

Space Complexity: `O(1)` for fixed dictionary size of 26 characters.
