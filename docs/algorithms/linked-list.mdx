# Linked List

A linear collection of data elements whose order is not given by their physical placement in memory. Memory storage does not have to be
contiguous as each element contains an address to the next element.

## Time Complexity

| Operation | Big-O | Note                                      |
| --------- | ----- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Access    | O(n)  | Must traverse from start                  |
| Search    | O(n)  |                                           |
| Insert    | O(1)  | Assuming you are at the node of insertion |
| Remove    | O(1)  | Assuming you are at the node of deletion  |

## Common Approaches to Linked List Questions

- Counting number of nodes in the linked list O(n)
- Reversing a linked list in-place
- Merging two linked lists together
- Finding the middle node of the linked list using two pointers

### Corner cases

- Empty linked list
- Cycles in linked list

## Example Solutions

### [Reverse Linked list](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/)

#### Solution 1: Recursive Approach

```py
# linkedList = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

def reverseList(self, head):
    # Base case: if 0 or 1 element return that element
    if not head or not head.next:
        return head
    last = self.reverseList(head.next) # [5, 4, 3, 2]
    head.next.next = head # [2] -> [1]
    head.next = None # [1] -> None
    return last # [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
```

Time Complexity: `O(n)` for looping through the linked list.

Space Complexity: `O(n)` for recursive stack of size `n`.

#### Solution 2: Iterative Approach <mark>(Prefered Solution)</mark>

```py
def reverseList(self, head):
    prev = None
    while head:
        curr = head # curr = [1]
        head = head.next # head = [2]
        curr.next = prev # [1](curr) -> None(prev)
        prev = curr # prev = [1]
    return prev
```

Time Complexity: `O(n)` for looping through the linked list.

Space Complexity: `O(1)` for constant variables.

<!-- ### [Linked List Cycle](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle/)

#### Solution 1: Sliding Window

```py
def maxArea(self, height):
```

Time Complexity: `O(n)` for looping through the `height` array.

Space Complexity: `O(1)` for 3 variables `max_area` and `left` and `right`. -->
