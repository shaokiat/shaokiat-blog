## Common Approaches to Arrays and Subarrays Questions

### Prefix Sum

```py
nums = [10, 20, 5, 15]
prefixSum = [10, 30, 35, 50]

prefixSum[i] = prefixSum[i - 1] + arr[i]
```

### Sliding Window

### Subarray Sum

### Kadane's Algorithm

## Example Solutions

### [Maximum Subarray](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-subarray/)

:::tip source
Solutions are adapted from this [LeetCode discussion](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-subarray/discuss/1595195/C%2B%2BPython-7-Simple-Solutions-w-Explanation-or-Brute-Force-%2B-DP-%2B-Kadane-%2B-Divide-and-Conquer) by _archit91_
:::

#### Solution 1: Dynamic Programming + Memoization

Bottom-up approach. `dp` array will store the maximum subarray sum at its respective index

```py
def maxSubArray(self, nums):
    dp = nums
    for i in range(1, len(nums)):
        # Store maximum of nums[i] or nums[i] + previous maximum
        dp[i] = max(nums[i], dp[i-1] + nums[i])
    return max(dp)

nums = [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]
dp = [-2, 1, -2, 4, 3, 5, 6, 1, 5] # dp array after running
```

Time Complexity: `O(n)` for looping through the `nums` array.

Space Complexity: `O(n)` for storing dp array of size `n`.

<br />

#### Solution 2: Kadane's Algorithm <mark>(Prefered Solution)</mark>

Optimize previous solution in terms of space by only storing the maximum of each iteration. The global maximum will then
be the maximum of all the iterations.

```py
def maxSubArray(self, nums):
    globalMax = localMax = nums[0] # Starts with nums[0]
    for num in nums[1:]: # Iterate through remaining array nums[1:]
        localMax = max(num, localMax + num)
        globalMax = max(globalMax, localMax)
    return globalMax
```

Time Complexity: `O(n)` for looping through the `nums` array.

Space Complexity: `O(1)` for 2 variables `globalMax` and `localMax`.

<br />

### [Container With Most Water](https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/)

#### Solution 1: Sliding Window

```py
def maxArea(self, height):
    max_area = 0
    left = 0
    right = len(height) - 1
    while left <= right: # terminating condition: left > right
        h = min(height[left], height[right])
        area = h * (right - left)
        max_area = max(max_area, area)
        # Shift window
        if height[left] < height[right]:
            left += 1
        else:
            right -= 1
    return max_area
```

Time Complexity: `O(n)` for looping through the `height` array.

Space Complexity: `O(1)` for 3 variables `max_area` and `left` and `right`.

<br />

### [Trapping Rain Water](https://leetcode.com/problems/trapping-rain-water/)

#### Solution 1: Sliding Window (Easier to understand)

```py
def trap(self, height):
    water = 0
    i, j = 0, len(height) - 1
    lmax, rmax = height[i], height[j]
    while i <= j: # Terminates when i > j
        lmax = max(lmax, height[i])
        rmax = max(rmax, height[j])
        if lmax <= rmax:
            water += lmax - height[i] # Add height difference from lmax
            i += 1
        else:
            water += rmax - height[j] # Add height difference from rmax
            j -= 1
    return water
```

Time Complexity: `O(n)` for looping through the `height` array.

Space Complexity: `O(1)` for constant variables.

#### Solution 2: Stack

```py
def trap(self, height):
    water = 0
    stack = []
    for i, h in enumerate(height):
        if stack and h > height[stack[-1]]:
            deal = stack.pop()
            if stack:
                w = i - stack[-1] - 1
                water += (min(h, height[deal]) - height[i]) * w
        stack.append(i)
    return water

```

**Invariant**: Stack always contain the indexes which have bar heights in decreasing order.

When we encounter a higher bar, we will pop the stack until we meet invariant then push the stack again.

Time Complexity: `O(n)` for looping through the `height` array.

Space Complexity: `O(n)` for using a stack.

### [Product of Array Except Self](https://leetcode.com/problems/product-of-array-except-self/)

#### Solution: Prefix + Postfix

:::tip
Here is an excellent [video explanation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNvIQI2wAjk) by NeetCode.
:::

Prefix product: Product of all numbers in the array before the current index.

Postfix product: Product of all numbers in the array after the current index.

Idea: Product except self is the product of prefix and postfix

```py
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]
prefix = [1, 2, 6, 24]
postfix = [24, 24, 12, 4]

result = [24, 12, 8, 6]
# Example: index 1
# prefix for nums[1] = 1
# postfix for nums[1] = 12
# product = 12
```

```py
'''
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]
res = [1, 1, 1, 1] - initial
prefix = [1, 1, 2, 6] - shifted by 1
postfix = [24, 12, 4, 1] - shifted by 1

res = [24, 12, 8, 6]
'''

def productExceptSelf(self, nums):
    n = len(nums)
    prefix = postfix = 1 # initialized as 1
    res = [1] * n
    for i in range(nums):
        res[i] *= prefix
        prefix *= nums[i]

        res[n-1-i] *= postfix
        postfix *= nums[n-1-i]
    return res
```

Time Complexity: `O(n)` for looping through the `nums` array.

Space Complexity: `O(1)` as result array is not counted.

<br />

### [Insert Interval](https://leetcode.com/problems/insert-interval/)

#### Solution:

```py
def insert(self, intervals, newInterval):
    n = newInterval
    res = []
    for index, i in enumerate(intervals):
        # Case 1: n greater than i
        if n[0] > i[1]:
            res.append(i)
        # Case 2: n smaller than i
        elif n[1] < i[0]:
            res.append(n)
            return res + intervals[index:]
        # Case 3: n overlaps with i -> merge
        else:
            n = [min(n[0], i[0]), max(n[1], i[1])]
    # append n to end of list
    res.append(n)
    return res
```

Time Complexity: `O(n)` for looping through the `intervals` array.

Space Complexity: `O(1)` as result array is not counted.

### [Sort Colors](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-colors/)

:::tip

[Amazing answer explanation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xbWSRZHqac) by NeetCode.

:::

#### Solution:

- left pointer pointing to the first 1
- right pointer pointing to the non-2

```py
def sortColors(self, nums):
    l = i = 0
    r = len(nums) - 1
    while i <= r:
        if nums[i] == 0: # swap with left pointer
            nums[l], nums[i] = nums[i], nums[l]
            l += 1 # move left pointer
        elif nums[i] == 2: # swap with right pointer
            nums[r], nums[i] = nums[i], nums[r]
            r -= 1 # move right pointer
            i -= 1 # Edge case: swapped 0 to nums[i]
        i += 1
```

Time Complexity: `O(n)` for one pass solution.

Space Complexity: `O(1)` as solution is in-place.

### [Find All Anagrams in a String](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-all-anagrams-in-a-string/)

:::tip

[Amazing answer explanation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8xtZy0fDKg) by NeetCode.

:::

#### Solution:

- Sliding window solution: Update dictionary according to sliding window

```py
def findAnagrams(self, s, p):
    if len(p) > len(s):
        return []
    pCount, sCount = {}, {}
    for i in range(len(p)):
        pCount[p[i]] = 1 + pCount.get(p[i], 0) # default to 0 if not found
        sCount[s[i]] = 1 + sCount.get(s[i], 0)
    res = [0] if pCount == sCount else []

    l = 0
    for r in range(len(p), len(s)): # Starts from len(p) onwards
        sCount[s[r]] = 1 + sCount.get(s[r], 0)
        sCount[s[l]] -= 1
        if sCount[s[l]] == 0: # Remove key from dict
            sCount.pop(s[l])
        l += 1
        if sCount == pCount:
            res.append(l)
    return res
```

Time Complexity: `O(n)` for one pass solution.

Space Complexity: `O(1)` as maximum space used is dictionary for 26 characters in the alphabet.

### [Minimum Window Substring](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-window-substring/)

#### Solution: Sliding window with Hashmaps

:::tip
Here is an excellent [video explanation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSto0O4AJbM) by NeetCode.
:::

```py
def minWindow(self, s, t):
    if t == "":
        return t
    wMap, tMap = {}, {}
    for i in t:
        tMap = 1 + tMap.get(i, 0)
    have, need = 0, len(tMap)
    res, resLen = [-1,-1], len(s) + 1
    l = 0
    for r in range(len(s)):
        c = s[r]
        wMap[c] = wMap.get(c, 0)
        if c in tMap and wMap[c] == tMap[c]:
            have += 1
        while have == need:
            # update result
            if (r - l + 1) < resLen:
                res = [l, r]
                resLen = r - l + 1
            # pop left
            lc = s[l]
            wMap[lc] -= 1
            if lc in tMap and wMap[lc] < tMap[lc]:
                have -= 1
            l += 1
    l, r = res
    return s[l, r-1] if resLen != len(s) + 1 else ""
```

Time Complexity: `O(n + m)` for looping through the string `s` of length `n` and string `t` of length `m`.

Space Complexity: `O(n + m)` for hashmaps used for `wMap` and `tMap`.

### [K Closest Points to Origin](https://leetcode.com/problems/k-closest-points-to-origin/)

#### Solution 1: Quick Select

```py
def kClosest(self, points):
    def euclidean(point):
        return point[0]**2 + point[1]**2

    def partition(l, r):
        rand = randint(l, r) # choose random pivot
        points[r], points[rand] = points[rand], points[r] # move pivot to end
        i, pivotDist = l, euclidean(points[rand])
        for j in range(l, r+1):
            if euclidean(points[j]) <= pivotDist:
                points[i], points[j] = points[j], points[i]
                i += 1
        return i-1
    l, r, p = 0, len(points) - 1, len(points)
    while p != k:
        p = partition(l, r)
        if p < k:
            l = p + 1
        else:
            r = p - 1
    return points[:pivot]
```

Time Complexity: `O(n)` on average, the partitions roughly eliminates half of the remaining elements each time => O(2N).

Space Complexity: `O(1)`, only constant space used.
