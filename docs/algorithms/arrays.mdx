## Common Approaches to Arrays and Subarrays Questions

### Prefix Sum

```py
nums = [10, 20, 5, 15]
prefixSum = [10, 30, 35, 50]

prefixSum[i] = prefixSum[i - 1] + arr[i]
```

### Sliding Window

### Subarray Sum

### Kadane's Algorithm

## Example Solutions

#### Solution 1: Dynamic Programming + Memoization

Bottom-up approach. `dp` array will store the maximum subarray sum at its respective index

```py
def maxSubArray(self, nums):
    dp = nums
    for i in range(1, len(nums)):
        # Store maximum of nums[i] or nums[i] + previous maximum
        dp[i] = max(nums[i], dp[i-1] + nums[i])
    return max(dp)

nums = [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]
dp = [-2, 1, -2, 4, 3, 5, 6, 1, 5] # dp array after running
```

Time Complexity: `O(n)` for looping through the `nums` array.

Space Complexity: `O(n)` for storing dp array of size `n`.

<br />

#### Solution 2: Kadane's Algorithm <mark>(Prefered Solution)</mark>

Optimize previous solution in terms of space by only storing the maximum of each iteration. The global maximum will then
be the maximum of all the iterations.

```py
def maxSubArray(self, nums):
    globalMax = localMax = nums[0] # Starts with nums[0]
    for num in nums[1:]: # Iterate through remaining array nums[1:]
        localMax = max(num, localMax + num)
        globalMax = max(globalMax, localMax)
    return globalMax
```

Time Complexity: `O(n)` for looping through the `nums` array.

Space Complexity: `O(1)` for 2 variables `globalMax` and `localMax`.

### [Container With Most Water](https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/)

#### Solution 1: Sliding Window

```py
def maxArea(self, height):
    max_area = 0
    left = 0
    right = len(height) - 1
    while left <= right: # terminating condition: left > right
        h = min(height[left], height[right])
        area = h * (right - left)
        max_area = max(max_area, area)
        # Shift window
        if height[left] < height[right]:
            left += 1
        else:
            right -= 1
    return max_area
```

Time Complexity: `O(n)` for looping through the `height` array.

Space Complexity: `O(1)` for 3 variables `max_area` and `left` and `right`.
