### [Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-tree/description/)

#### Solution 1: Recursive Approach

```py
# class TreeNode:
# def __init__(self, x):
#   self.val = x
#   self.left = None
#   self.right = None

def lowestCommonAncestor(self, root, p, q):
  if not root or root == p or root == q:
    return root

  left = self.lowestCommonAncestor(root.left, p, q)
  right = self.lowestCommonAncestor(root.right, p, q)

  if left and right:
    return root
  else:
    return left or right
```

Time Complexity: `O(n)` for traversing the entire binary tree.

Space Complexity: `O(n)` for the size of recursion stack.

#### Solution 2: Iterative Approach

```py
# class TreeNode:
# def __init__(self, x):
#   self.val = x
#   self.left = None
#   self.right = None

def lowestCommonAncestor(self, root, p, q):
  stack = [root]
  parent = {root: None}
  while p not in parent or q not in parent:
    node = stack.pop()
    if node.left:
      stack.append(node.left)
      parent[node.left] = node
    if node.right:
      stack.append(node.right)
      parent[node.right] = node

  ancestor = set()
  while p:
    ancestor.add(p)
    p = parent[p]
  while q not in ancestor:
    q = parent[q]
  return q
```

Time Complexity: `O(n)` for traversing the entire binary tree.

Space Complexity: `O(n)` for the spaced used for stack and parent dictionary.

### [Minimum Height Trees](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-height-trees/)

#### Solution:

```py
def findMinHeightTrees(self, n: int, edges: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
    if n == 1:
        return [0]
    # Build adjacency list
    graph = [[] for i in range(n)]
    for a, b in edges: # undirected edges
        graph[b].append(a)
        graph[a].append(b)

    leaves = []
    for i in range(n):
        if len(graph[i]) == 1:
            leaves.append(i)
    while n > 2: # At most 2 nodes in final answer
        newLeaves = []
        n -= len(leaves)
        for leaf in leaves:
            i = graph[leaf].pop()
            graph[i].remove(leaf)
            if len(graph[i]) == 1:
                newLeaves.append(i)
        leaves = newLeaves
    return leaves

```

Time Complexity: `O(n)` for traversing the entire tree.

Space Complexity: `O(n^2)` for the space used by adjacency list.

```py
# Complete the 'getMinCost' function below.
#
# The function is expected to return an INTEGER.
# The function accepts following parameters:
#  1. INTEGER_ARRAY val
#  2. UNWEIGHTED_INTEGER_GRAPH t
#

# For the unweighted graph, <name>:
#
# 1. The number of nodes is <name>_nodes.
# 2. The number of edges is <name>_edges.
# 3. An edge exists between <name>_from[i] and <name>_to[i].

def getMinCost(val, t_nodes, t_from, t_to):
    # Write your code here
    for i in range(t_nodes):
        val[i] = val[i] % 2
    adjList = [[] for _ in range(t_nodes)]
    for i in range(len(t_from)):
        adjList[t_from[i]-1].append(t_to[i]-1)
        adjList[t_to[i]-1].append(t_from[i]-1)
    # get leaves
    leaves = [i for i in range(t_nodes) if len(adjList[i]) == 1]
    remaining = t_nodes
    cost = 0
    while leaves and remaining > 2:
        remaining -= len(leaves)
        newLeaves = []
        for leaf in leaves:
            parent = adjList[leaf].pop()
            adjList[parent].remove(leaf)
            if val[leaf] == 1: #odd
                cost += 1
                val[parent] = 1 - val[parent]

            if len(adjList[parent]) == 1:
                newLeaves.append(parent)
        leaves = newLeaves
    # Check if remaining 2 leaves are odd
    if leaves and val[leaves[0]] == 1:
        cost += 1
    return cost
```
