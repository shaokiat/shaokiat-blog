# Dynamic Programming (Top Down)

Dynamic programming has been my nemesis for awhile now and it is about time I tackle dynamic programming
using the same approach for dynamic programming.

### What is Dynamic Programming

Find out all possible solutions, then pick out best solution.

Recursive in nature.

**Principle of Optimality:** A problem can be solved by taking a sequence of decisions to get the optimal solution.

### Top Down Approach

- Memoization
- Iterative function calls
- **Identify recurrence relation**

## Example 1: Road Trip

:::note Context
Below is a question I encountered during one of the technical assessment that _tripped_ me.
:::
You are going on a road trip. You are going to get in your trusty car and drive to Panglossia, where
you will spend a nice vacation by the beach. Your car holds C litre of petrol and gets _m_ km per litre. You are handed a list of the n petrol stations
are on the road and the price they sell petrol.

Let distance[i] be the distance of the i-th gas station from Start, let cost[i] be the cost of petrol per litre
at the i-th station. Furthermore, you can assume that for any two stations i and j, the distance |distance[i] - distance[j]|
between them is divisible by _m_. You start out with an empty tank at station 1. Your final destination is station _n_.

:::important Hint
Hardest part is identifying the recurrence relation
:::

### Recurrence Relation

```
for each possible i:
C(station j, k) = C(station j+1, k - d + i) + cost(station j) * i

C(station j, k): minimum cost to reach destination from station j, with k litre in tank
k: k litre of fuel
d: distance from station j to station j+1
i: amount of fuel topped up
```

### Approach

You can observe that if you have already solved the problem for all j' > j, then it is not hard
to compute _C(station j, k)_.

If you start with _k_ litres and it is _d_ km from the next station, then for all _i_,
lookup the already computed _C(station j+1, k - d + i)_, which tells you the minimum cost for
arriving at station _j+1_ with _k - d + i_ litres of petrol. Add this cost per litre at station j times _i_,
and choose the _i_ that is the cheapest.

Work in reverse until you get to the first station, and you will eventually find the cheapest way
to reach destination.

### Solution

```py
def minimumCost(distance, n, C, cost, m):
  dp = [[0 for i in range(C)] for j in range(n)]
  for j in range(n - 2, -1, -1): # Traverse all stations in reverse
    for k in range(C): # How much fuel in tank starting from station j
      d_next = (distance[j+1] - distance[j]) // m
      min_ = float('inf')
      for i in range(C-k): # How much fuel topped up
        if k + i >= d_next:
          min_ = min(min_, dp[j+1][k - d_next + i] + cost[j] * i)
      dp[j][k] = min_
  print(dp)
  return (dp[0][0])

C = 10 # Capacity of petrol; starts with 0
n = 3
cost = [10,1,1]
d = [0, 20, 100] # distance of ith station from start
m = 10 # km/litre

minimumCost(d, n, C, cost, m)
```
