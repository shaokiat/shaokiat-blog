# Binary Search

## Iterative Binary Search

This is the common binary search where a sorted array `nums` is given and we are tasked to find `target` in that array. <br/>
Returns the `index` of the target if it exist in the array, else returns `-1`.

**Time Complexity**: `O(logn)` <br/>
**Space Complexity**: `O(1)` <br/>
Time complexity is O(logn) as the search range is halved every iteration until target is found. The iterative approach will
give a O(1) space complexity.

```py
def binarySearch(nums, target):
    left, right = 0, len(nums)-1
    while left <= right: # Search interval = [left, right]
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if nums[mid] == target: # target found! Return index
            return mid
        elif nums[mid] < target: # recurse right -> [mid+1, right]
            left = mid + 1
        elif nums[mid] > target: # recurse left -> [left, mid-1]
            right = mid - 1
    # Target not found -> return -1
    return -1
```

### Search Interval

```py
while left <= right:...
```

This gives us a closed interval of `[left, right]` to search from where both the left and right boundaries are included. This
also means that our initial `right` boundary would have to be `len(arr) - 1`.

**Case 1:** `nums[mid] < target`<br />
Target lies on the right side of `mid` and we would have to set our search interval
to `[mid + 1, right]`. To do so, we have to set our left interval to `mid + 1`.

**Case 2:** `nums[mid] > target` <br/>
Target lies on the left side of `mid` and we would have to set our search interval to `[left, mid - 1]`. To do so,
we have to set our right interval to `mid - 1`.

The terminating condition for this while loop would be when `left > right`.
