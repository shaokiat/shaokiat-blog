# Dynamic Programming

Dynamic programming has been my nemesis for awhile now and it is about time I tackle dynamic programming
using the same approach for dynamic programming.

### What is Dynamic Programming

Find out all possible solutions, then pick out best solution.

Recursive in nature.

**Principle of Optimality:** A problem can be solved by taking a sequence of decisions to get the optimal solution.

### Top Down Approach

1. Identify **recurrence relation**
2. Recursive solution (top-down)
3. Recursive + Memoization (top-down)
4. Iterative + Memoization (bottom-up)
5. Iterative + N variables (bottom-up)

## Example Solutions

### Road Trip

:::note Context
Below is a question I had encountered during one of the technical assessment that _tripped_ me.
:::
You are going on a road trip. You are going to get in your trusty car and drive to Panglossia, where
you will spend a nice vacation by the beach. Your car holds C litre of petrol and gets _m_ km per litre. You are handed a list of the n petrol stations
are on the road and the price they sell petrol.

Let distance[i] be the distance of the i-th gas station from Start, let cost[i] be the cost of petrol per litre
at the i-th station. Furthermore, you can assume that for any two stations i and j, the distance |distance[i] - distance[j]|
between them is divisible by _m_. You start out with an empty tank at station 1. Your final destination is station _n_.

:::important Hint
Hardest part is identifying the recurrence relation

#### Recurrence Relation

<div style={{ textAlign: "center" }}>
  <img
    src="/shaokiat-blog/img/algo/dp-road-trip.png"
    alt="roadtrip"
    width="600"
  />
</div>

```
for each possible i: C(station j, k) = C(station j+1, k - d + i) + cost(station j) * i

C(station j, k): minimum cost to reach destination from station j, with k litre in tank
k: k litre of fuel
d: distance from station j to station j+1
i: amount of fuel topped up

```

#### Approach

You can observe that if you have already solved the problem for all j' > j, then it is not hard
to compute _C(station j, k)_.

If you start with _k_ litres and it is _d_ km from the next station, then for all _i_,
lookup the already computed _C(station j+1, k - d + i)_, which tells you the minimum cost for
arriving at station _j+1_ with _k - d + i_ litres of petrol. Add this cost per litre at station j times _i_,
and choose the _i_ that is the cheapest.

Work in reverse until you get to the first station, and you will eventually find the cheapest way
to reach destination.

#### Solution

```py
def minimumCost(distance, n, C, cost, m):
  dp = [[0 for i in range(C)] for j in range(n)]
  for j in range(n - 2, -1, -1): # Traverse all stations in reverse
    for k in range(C): # How much fuel in tank starting from station j
      d_next = (distance[j+1] - distance[j]) // m
      min_ = float('inf')
      for i in range(C-k): # How much fuel topped up
        if k + i >= d_next:
          min_ = min(min_, dp[j+1][k - d_next + i] + cost[j] * i)
      dp[j][k] = min_
  print(dp)
  return (dp[0][0])

C = 10 # Capacity of petrol; starts with 0
n = 3
cost = [10,1,1]
d = [0, 20, 100] # distance of ith station from start
m = 10 # km/litre

minimumCost(d, n, C, cost, m)
```

### [House Robber](https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber/)

#### Recurrence Relation

Robber has 2 options: (Knap-sack problems)

- Rob current house
- Don't rob current house

Robber has to maximize profits using these 2 scenarios:

- Rob current house + loot from houses before the previous
- Loot from the previous house and those before that

```
rob(i) = max(rob(i - 2) + i, rob(i - 1))
```

#### Solution

Let `rob1 = i - 2` and `rob2 = i - 1`.

```py
# [rob1, rob2, i, i+1, ...]

def rob(nums):
  rob1 = rob2 = 0
  for i in nums:
    temp = max(rob1 + i, rob2)
    # Shift rob variable forward
    rob1 = rob2
    rob2 = temp
  return rob2
```

**Space Complexity**: `O(1)` as there are always only 2 variables (rob1, rob2) used.

**Time Complexity**: `O(n)` as there is only one loop through the nums array.

#### Solution 1: DP with Top-Down and Bottom-Up

```py
def updateMatrix(self, mat):
    r, c = len(mat), len(mat[0])
    # Top-Down Approach
    for i in range(r):
      for j in range(c):
        if mat[i][j] > 0: # cells that needs to be updated
          left = mat[i][j-1] if j > 0 else math.inf
          top = mat[i-1][j] if i > 0 else math.inf
          mat[i][j] = 1 + min(left, top)

    # Bottom-Up Approach
    for i in range(r-1, -1, -1):
      for j in range(c-1, -1, -1):
        if mat[i][j] > 0:
          right = mat[i][j+1] if j < c-1 else math.inf
          bot = mat[i+1][j] if i < r-1 else math.inf
          mat[i][j] = min(mat[i][j], 1 + right, 1 + bot)
    return mat
```

Time Complexity: `O(M * N)` due to the double for loops to run through the matrix.

Space Complexity: `O(1)` as no additional data structures were used.

#### Solution 2: BFS starting from zeroes

```py
def updateMatrix(self, mat):
  DIR = [(0,1), (1,0), (0,-1), (-1,0)]
  queue = []
  for i in range(len(mat)):
      for j in range(len(mat[0])):
        if mat[i][j] == 0:
          queue.append((i, j))
        else:
          mat[i][j] = -1 # marked as not processed

  while queue:
    r, c = queue.pop(0)
    # Check all four directions
    for x, y in DIR:
      nr, nc = r + x, c + y
      # Check out of bounds and already processed
      if nr < 0 or nr >= len(mat) or nc < 0 or nc >= len(mat[0]) or mat[nr][nc] != -1:
        continue
      mat[nr][nc] = 1 + mat[r][c]
      queue.append((nr, nc))

  return mat
```

Time Complexity: `O(M * N)` due to the double for loops to run through the matrix.

Space Complexity: `O(M * N)` due to the queue used.
