# What is Web 3.0?

## What is the Web even?

The [World Wide Web](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/World_Wide_Web) is also commonly referred
to as **the Web** â€” an interconnected system of public webpages accessible through the Internet.

Common components in **the Web**:

- [HTTP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/HTTP) or [SMTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Mail_Transfer_Protocol)
  protocol to govern data transfer between server and client.
- [URL](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/URL) (uniform resource locator) supplied by client to access web pages.
- [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/HTML) (hypertext markup language), a common format for publishing web documents.

These crucial components are what made the Web so great in today's context, leading to a boom in the technological age.
However, there are also shortcomings about the current state of the Web that developers and users alike are trying to circumvent, mainly
from the centralization of the Web.

In this post, we shall explore into some of Web 3.0 characteristics and how it compares to its predecessors.

There is a difference between **URL** and **Domain Name** although they are sometimes used interchangeably.

### Web 1.0

Information Era. Birth of [Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page).

<br />

### Web 2.0

Birth of web applications. Facebook, Twitter.
Centralized platforms that offers incredible services.
Data kept and controlled by companies.

<br />

### And finally, Web 3.0

The next generation of web, also known as the [executable web](https://dev.to/pragativerma18/evolution-of-web-42eh).
Data is not owned but rather shared, with services on the blockchain.

- Web 3.0 operates on decentralized protocols (founding blocks of blockchain and cryptocurrency technology)
- Transparent, [Decentralized](#the-decentralized-web) and Trustless
- AI-driven services

#### The Decentralized Web

Rise of distributed ledgers and blockchain storage enables data decentralization and creation of a transparent and secure
environment, subverting Web 2.0's centralization, surveillance, and questionable use of data collected. This allows
individuals to _rightfully_ own their data.
