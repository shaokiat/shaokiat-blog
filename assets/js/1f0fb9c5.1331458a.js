I have always been a big fan of Science, constantly\\nintrigued by how things work, and frequently fascinated by new scientific discoveries. In fact, a person that I really looked up to is none other\\nthan Elon Musk, not because of his riches, but his passion in tackling the hardest problems and playing a major role in advancing the Human race.\\n\\nWhy I believe the scientific method should be the standard to establish ideas.\\n\\n### What is the [Scientific Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method)?\\n\\n<div style={{ textAlign: \\"center\\" }}>\\n  <img\\n    src=\\"/shaokiat-blog/img/scientific_method.png\\"\\n    alt=\\"scientific method\\"\\n    width=\\"300\\"\\n  />\\n</div>\\n\\n### What is a Scientific Theory?\\n\\nA scientific theory is a well-confirmed framework of ideas that explains (or describes) what we observe.\\n\\nScientific ideas are never absolutely certain. How can we even be absolutely certain about anything? Our brain also has its fair share of flaws.\\nWhat we can only do is to establish the best possible theory at that point in time.\\n\\nNo scientific theory, no matter how strongly supported by\\navailable evidence, is final and unchallengeable; any good\\ntheory is always exposed to the possibility of being modified or\\neven overthrown by new evidence.

Always adaptable to changes and better ideas.\\nA process that we should also constantly emulate in our lives.\\n\\n### Why then?\\n\\nPerhaps what inspired me to write this blog post is the notion that people readily accepts ideas that cannot be challenged. And that important decisions\\nand laws are made based on these ideas.

People in the bad tier have to fear outsourcing. People in the good tier don\u2019t. Each tier finds it hard to believe the other tier exists. And so the complaints and recommendations for one tier are usually completely different from the other tier, almost as if people are living in two different worlds. This essay describes what these two tiers look like.\\n:::\\n\\n### _Bad Tier_\\n\\n> This is where you hear stories about stagnating salaries, where people say that you are at risk of being outsourced, where engineers try to jump to management as quickly as possible, because being an engineer in the bad tier is about as great as being a garment worker in an Industrial Age shirt shop.\\n\\n> I\u2019ll define bad tier as \\"could plausibly be outsourced to a cheaper country\\"\\n\\n> For instance, if software engineers at your company are treated like shit (that is, you can imagine that some day, plausibly, they lay off the team and recruit in India) then it\u2019s likely that the company doesn\u2019t view its programmers as particularly valuable. The business term for this situation is that the company sees the programmers as a \\"cost centre\\".\\n> It could be that the work isn\u2019t very important to the business of the company. It could also be that management \u2013 rightly or wrongly \u2013 doesn\u2019t see much value in maintaining in-house technology.\\n\\n### _Good Tier_\\n\\n> The reason these friends moved out from those companies and found better jobs was because we met up occasionally, and word got out through the computing grapevine that good companies existed out there.\\n\\nThis is something that I definitely agree where we should be open with our friends on job opportunities so that we can all grow together, instead of avoiding discussion\\non salary for fear of feeling embarrassed or even boastful. The goal is to better understand our value and figure out a way to get paid what we\'re worth if that is not already happening. [See this](https://www.themuse.com/advice/its-time-to-start-telling-our-friends-how-much-money-we-make)\\n\\n> I\u2019ll talk more about getting into the good tier later. But to me, that isn\u2019t as important as convincing you that it exists.\\n\\n> There\u2019s a real difference in optimism when you know good jobs await you around the corner, so long as you figure out how to get into them. It\u2019s much better than thinking all the jobs out there are as bad as the one you\u2019re currently in.\\n\\nThe article places heavy emphasis on the existence of good companies in Singapore, which is good in a sense whereby potential software engineers have knowledge and\\noptimism to work towards better companies.\\n\\n> being in the good tier doesn\u2019t guarantee high salaries or a good experience...they\u2019re still in a completely different world from the bad tier programmers. They don\u2019t ever have to worry about outsourcing, they know they\u2019re considered high value.\\n\\n### Personal Opinions\\n\\n> With this good tier/bad tier divide, this is easy to answer: the good tier companies experience the lack of talent, while employees in the bad tier companies complain.\\n\\n> When you\u2019re in the bad tier, companies care about what you can do for them. It\u2019s a purely transactional relationship...(some) see these companies and conclude that what you need to do to get hired is \\"have skill in X\\", and CS schools don\u2019t teach you \\"skill in X\\", so therefore CS curriculums are \\"outdated\\" and \\"bad\\".\\n> When you get to the good tier...it\u2019s frankly ridiculous to hire people who can \u201cjust do X\u201d. You want engineers who can adapt to new technologies, evaluate competing approaches\\n\\nThese are some of the words that struck deep within me - that I must remind myself not to fall into the \'bad tier\' of Tech companies where tech is not valued and I will inevitably end up on Reddit complaining. This article serves as a good reference and reminder that I should always be searching and working towards companies that value my skills and contributions I can bring to the team and that I should never settle for less. Of course this is easier said than done and I definitely must put in my utmost effort in preparations for the interviews ahead.\\n\\nAs of writing this, I have about one and a half years before graduating from NUS and I will make full use of this time to scale and conquer Mount Everest (Good Companies).\\n\\n\x3c!-- NUS Hackers are not typically \'normal\' friends or students that people or rather I hang out with(perhaps its just me). It takes\\na certain passion and technical skillsets to get into NUS Hackers and for the author to say that his \'normal\' friends in NUS Hackers is\\nalready a questionable statement. --\x3e"},{"id":"Welcome","metadata":{"permalink":"/shaokiat-blog/blog/Welcome","editUrl":"https://github.com/shaokiat/shaokiat-blog/tree/main/blog/2021-11-11-first-blog.md","source":"@site/blog/2021-11-11-first-blog.md","title":"Why am I writing this blog?","description":"This marks the start of my very first blog post and the start of my journey to reach for greater heights.","date":"2021-11-11T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"November 11, 2021","tags":[],"readingTime":0.65,"truncated":false,"authors":[{"name":"Lim Shao Kiat","title":"Author","url":"https://www.shaokiat.xyz","imageURL":"https://github.com/shaokiat.png","key":"shaokiat"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"Welcome","title":"Why am I writing this blog?","authors":["shaokiat"],"tags":[]},"prevItem":{"title":"Thoughts on (The Two Tiers of Singapore\'s Tech Companies)","permalink":"/shaokiat-blog/blog/good-company"}},"content":"This marks the start of my very first blog post and the start of my journey to reach for greater heights.\\nI want to pen down my thoughts through my job search journey as a software engineer and whoever is reading this (yes that\'s you :flushed:) will\\nserve as witness and reminder for me to hold myself accountable :bulb:.\\n\\n### About me\\n\\nAs of writing this blog post, I am in my third year of NUS, majoring in Computer Science.\\n\\n### Goals\\n\\n- Securing a 2022 Summer Internship at a [Good](/blog/good-company) company\\n- Overseas Exchange at University of California\\n- Securing job at a [Good](/blog/good-company) company (SV/SG)\\n\\nI had just received an offer to exchange at University of California, a dream come true, yet at the same time feeling uneasy."}]}')}}]);
