So for the month of July 2023, I began tracking\\nthe statistics of my experience with dating apps in Singapore as a 25 years old male and as a free-user.\\n\\n## Part I: The Game of Swipes\\n\\nFirst of all, we should all understand the phenomenon in the dating apps scene. I happen to chance upon this fantastic video\\nthat explains the situation with such accuracy, using models and assumptions - a language spoken by data scientists and statisticians.\\n\\nPlease give the video a watch before continuing and I will be summarizing the learning points from this video and base of my\\nobservations from it as well.\\n\\n<div className=\\"dating-app-container\\">\\n  <iframe\\n    height=\\"100%\\"\\n    width=\\"90%\\"\\n    src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/x3lypVnJ0HM\\"\\n    frameborder=\\"0\\"\\n    allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\\"\\n    allowfullscreen\\n  />\\n  <div>Source: Memeable Data on Youtube</div>\\n</div>\\n\\n### Why are men getting fewer matches?\\n\\nThe median number of matches for men is skewed by the imbalance of several factors:\\n\\n1. Significantly more men than women uses dating apps (Gender imbalance)\\n2. Men give more likes than women (Engagement bias)\\n3. A small share of users get a big share of the likes (Engagement imbalance)\\n\\n### What is a result of these?\\n\\nMen:\\n\\n- As men don\'t get as much likes, they start giving likes more generously to improve their chances of getting matched.\\n- Studies indicated that dating apps can have a negative impact on self-esteem, with a stronger effect on men.\\n\\nWomen:\\n\\n- Women are overwhelmed with choices, making them think more carefully about who they give likes to, and since guys are so\\n  generous with their likes, there is a good chance he is not even genuinely interested.\\n- Women often have to find strategies to deal with intrusive behavior from men.\\n\\n### What My Strategy?\\n\\nAs I believe I do not belong in the top 15%, I naturally applied the strategy as mentioned above. And this means that in\\norder to acquire more matches, I need to invest additional time in optimizing a good dating profile, and be more generous with my likes.\\n\\n## Part II: Matches Statistics\\n\\nBelow is a Sankey Chart of the statistics for the month of July 2023.\\n\\n#### Sankey Chart of Dating App Statistics\\n\\n<div\\n  style={{\\n    textAlign: \\"center\\",\\n    display: \\"flex\\",\\n    justifyContent: \\"space-evenly\\",\\n  }}\\n>\\n  <img\\n    src=\\"/shaokiat-blog/img/blog/sankey-dating-app.png\\"\\n    alt=\\"sankey chart\\"\\n    width=\\"800\\"\\n  />\\n</div>\\n<br />\\n\\n### What could be optimised?\\n\\nFrom the observation of the chart,\\n\\n- 30% of matches did not end up with any messages at all. And since I have to start the conversations the majority of the\\n  time, perhaps I could be more careful and less generous with my likes.\\n- 27% of matches that did have messages, never replied, possibly indicating that I should look into working on my opening message.\\n\\n### Limitations\\n\\nThis chart is limited in information to draw conclusions from, and only offers a big picture view of the statistics.\\nThe chart does not tell me about the quality of the matches from each platform and there could potentially be data imbalance\\npresent in each app, possibly due to different the demographic of the users.\\n\\nA more detailed approach could be used to include factors such as user feedback,\\nsatisfaction ratings, success stories, or user demographics. These additional data could then provide some insights into each\\nthe respective dating apps.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nIn conclusion, keeping track of the data from personal experiences is indeed an interesting way to gain insights into my own preferences,\\npatterns and experiences. This self-reflection can hopefully lead to enhanced decision making, and ultimately an increased\\nlikelihood of finding a potential partner.\\n\\nThis is definitely a good experiment to get me more proactive and mindful about the data that surrounds me in the digital landscape\\nas I continue to explore and understand the broader implications of data in my life."},{"id":"view","metadata":{"permalink":"/shaokiat-blog/blog/view","editUrl":"https://github.com/shaokiat/shaokiat-blog/tree/main/blog/2023-04-09-a-refreshing-view.mdx","source":"@site/blog/2023-04-09-a-refreshing-view.mdx","title":"A Refreshing View","description":"This is a recount of an experience during my exchange at UC Santa Cruz, that has left me thinking about the stark difference in culture of the US to that of my home country, Singapore.","date":"2023-04-09T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"April 9, 2023","tags":[],"readingTime":3.325,"truncated":false,"authors":[{"name":"Lim Shao Kiat","title":"Author","url":"https://www.shaokiat.xyz","imageURL":"https://github.com/shaokiat.png","key":"shaokiat"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"view","title":"A Refreshing View","authors":["shaokiat"],"tags":[]},"prevItem":{"title":"An Analysis on My Dating App Experience","permalink":"/shaokiat-blog/blog/dating-app-analysis"},"nextItem":{"title":"The Questioning of Science","permalink":"/shaokiat-blog/blog/science"}},"content":"This is a recount of an experience during my exchange at UC Santa Cruz, that has left me thinking about the stark difference in culture of the US to that of my home country, Singapore.\\n\\nI had embarked on a backpacking trip with the school\'s recreation club to Big Sur, headed by two amazing student guides. I was joined by my buddy, Vincent, whom I had became good friends with\\nprior to the trip. We were all thrilled to be part of the expedition and the drive was long but scenic, with breathtaking views of the Pacific Ocean\\nand towering cliffs that hugged the coastline.\\n\\nWe began our hike into Big Sur and and eventually to Buckeye Camp where we would settle down for the night.\\n\\n<div\\n  style={{\\n    textAlign: \\"center\\",\\n    display: \\"flex\\",\\n  }}\\n>\\n  <div style={{ flex: \\"1\\", paddingRight: \\"10px\\" }}>\\n    <img src=\\"/shaokiat-blog/img/blog/hiking.jpg\\" alt=\\"hiking\\" width=\\"300\\" />\\n  </div>\\n  <div style={{ flex: \\"1\\", paddingRight: \\"10px\\" }}>\\n    <img src=\\"/shaokiat-blog/img/blog/buckeye.jpg\\" alt=\\"hiking\\" width=\\"300\\" />\\n  </div>\\n</div>\\n\\n<br />\\n\\nWe were extremely lucky that night to experience the most surreal star gazing experience upon the clear, crisp night, along with camping games\\nthat filled the air with laughter and joy. Being able to see the Milky Way with my naked eye was a humbling experience that has left me questioning\\nmy own existence. Every corner of the sky were lit up with countless stars, a scene that would have never existed in Singapore.\\n\\n<div\\n  style={{\\n    textAlign: \\"center\\",\\n    display: \\"flex\\",\\n    justifyContent: \\"space-evenly\\",\\n  }}\\n>\\n  <img src=\\"/shaokiat-blog/img/blog/milkyway.jpg\\" alt=\\"milky way\\" width=\\"400\\" />\\n</div>\\n<br />\\n\\n### The Incident\\n\\nWhile we were left to our own stations to settle down for the night, my buddy Vincent, decided to roll a joint. Some essential background information is that while\\nweed is legal in California, it is not legal according to the Federal laws, which still governs State parks and school trips as they receive federal fundings.\\nAs he was about done with the joint, the two student guides found out about it and were furious, stating that this is the first time they had someone smoke on an\\nexpedition. They explained that they were angry as they might lose their jobs, and it was a dangerous fire hazard, especially during the dry Fall season that we are in\\nright now.\\n\\nThe two guides then said that they were going to confiscate his \'apparatus\' and hand it over to the head of the recreation club. This incident ruined the happy moment\\nand the mood got really awkward the following morning as we began our hike back.\\n\\n### Face the Music\\n\\nA week later, I met Vincent and what he told me was something that I would never have expected. He said that he met the head of the recreation club to discuss about the smoking\\nincident, and what was shocking was that instead of giving him a harsh punishment, the head actually apologized on behalf of his student guides for\\nconfiscating his things without permission, and returned his things back to him. In the end, Vincent got let off with a just warning not to do it again.\\n\\n### Stark Differences\\n\\nThe resolution for this incident left me thinking about the stark difference in cultures, and that how much the Americans value privacy as well as mutual respect. This would\\nhave only been possible if the person of authority respects the people under him to do the right thing and learn from their mistakes.\\n\\nFrom where I came from, it is ingrained in me that incidents like these would have been dealt with the heaviest punishment. We were taught never to question authority,\\nand people with authority usually gets away with anything they do.\\n\\nNow, I am not saying that the resolution is right or wrong, just that it would have never cross my mind that such a resolution is even possible.\\nThis has definitely expanded my horizon as to how people from different cultures deal with conflicts, and there are definitely learning points from this incident."},{"id":"science","metadata":{"permalink":"/shaokiat-blog/blog/science","editUrl":"https://github.com/shaokiat/shaokiat-blog/tree/main/blog/2022-06-27-science.mdx","source":"@site/blog/2022-06-27-science.mdx","title":"The Questioning of Science","description":"In this blog post, I want to discuss about a topic that I am deeply passionate about.

People in the bad tier have to fear outsourcing. People in the good tier don\u2019t. Each tier finds it hard to believe the other tier exists. And so the complaints and recommendations for one tier are usually completely different from the other tier, almost as if people are living in two different worlds. This essay describes what these two tiers look like.\\n:::\\n\\n### _Bad Tier_\\n\\n> This is where you hear stories about stagnating salaries, where people say that you are at risk of being outsourced, where engineers try to jump to management as quickly as possible, because being an engineer in the bad tier is about as great as being a garment worker in an Industrial Age shirt shop.\\n\\n> I\u2019ll define bad tier as \\"could plausibly be outsourced to a cheaper country\\"\\n\\n> For instance, if software engineers at your company are treated like shit (that is, you can imagine that some day, plausibly, they lay off the team and recruit in India) then it\u2019s likely that the company doesn\u2019t view its programmers as particularly valuable. The business term for this situation is that the company sees the programmers as a \\"cost centre\\".\\n> It could be that the work isn\u2019t very important to the business of the company. It could also be that management \u2013 rightly or wrongly \u2013 doesn\u2019t see much value in maintaining in-house technology.\\n\\n### _Good Tier_\\n\\n> The reason these friends moved out from those companies and found better jobs was because we met up occasionally, and word got out through the computing grapevine that good companies existed out there.\\n\\nThis is something that I definitely agree where we should be open with our friends on job opportunities so that we can all grow together, instead of avoiding discussion\\non salary for fear of feeling embarrassed or even boastful. The goal is to better understand our value and figure out a way to get paid what we\'re worth if that is not already happening. [See this](https://www.themuse.com/advice/its-time-to-start-telling-our-friends-how-much-money-we-make)\\n\\n> I\u2019ll talk more about getting into the good tier later. But to me, that isn\u2019t as important as convincing you that it exists.\\n\\n> There\u2019s a real difference in optimism when you know good jobs await you around the corner, so long as you figure out how to get into them. It\u2019s much better than thinking all the jobs out there are as bad as the one you\u2019re currently in.\\n\\nThe article places heavy emphasis on the existence of good companies in Singapore, which is good in a sense whereby potential software engineers have knowledge and\\noptimism to work towards better companies.\\n\\n> being in the good tier doesn\u2019t guarantee high salaries or a good experience...they\u2019re still in a completely different world from the bad tier programmers. They don\u2019t ever have to worry about outsourcing, they know they\u2019re considered high value.\\n\\n### Personal Opinions\\n\\n> With this good tier/bad tier divide, this is easy to answer: the good tier companies experience the lack of talent, while employees in the bad tier companies complain.\\n\\n> When you\u2019re in the bad tier, companies care about what you can do for them. It\u2019s a purely transactional relationship...(some) see these companies and conclude that what you need to do to get hired is \\"have skill in X\\", and CS schools don\u2019t teach you \\"skill in X\\", so therefore CS curriculums are \\"outdated\\" and \\"bad\\".\\n> When you get to the good tier...it\u2019s frankly ridiculous to hire people who can \u201cjust do X\u201d. You want engineers who can adapt to new technologies, evaluate competing approaches\\n\\nThese are some of the words that struck deep within me - that I must remind myself not to fall into the \'bad tier\' of Tech companies where tech is not valued and I will inevitably end up on Reddit complaining. This article serves as a good reference and reminder that I should always be searching and working towards companies that value my skills and contributions I can bring to the team and that I should never settle for less. Of course this is easier said than done and I definitely must put in my utmost effort in preparations for the interviews ahead.\\n\\nAs of writing this, I have about one and a half years before graduating from NUS and I will make full use of this time to scale and conquer Mount Everest (Good Companies).\\n\\n\x3c!-- NUS Hackers are not typically \'normal\' friends or students that people or rather I hang out with(perhaps its just me). It takes\\na certain passion and technical skillsets to get into NUS Hackers and for the author to say that his \'normal\' friends in NUS Hackers is\\nalready a questionable statement. --\x3e"},{"id":"Welcome","metadata":{"permalink":"/shaokiat-blog/blog/Welcome","editUrl":"https://github.com/shaokiat/shaokiat-blog/tree/main/blog/2021-11-11-first-blog.md","source":"@site/blog/2021-11-11-first-blog.md","title":"Why am I writing this blog?","description":"This marks the start of my very first blog post and the start of my journey to reach for greater heights.","date":"2021-11-11T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"November 11, 2021","tags":[],"readingTime":0.65,"truncated":false,"authors":[{"name":"Lim Shao Kiat","title":"Author","url":"https://www.shaokiat.xyz","imageURL":"https://github.com/shaokiat.png","key":"shaokiat"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"Welcome","title":"Why am I writing this blog?","authors":["shaokiat"],"tags":[]},"prevItem":{"title":"Thoughts on (The Two Tiers of Singapore\'s Tech Companies)","permalink":"/shaokiat-blog/blog/good-company"}},"content":"This marks the start of my very first blog post and the start of my journey to reach for greater heights.\\nI want to pen down my thoughts through my job search journey as a software engineer and whoever is reading this (yes that\'s you :flushed:) will\\nserve as witness and reminder for me to hold myself accountable :bulb:.\\n\\n### About me\\n\\nAs of writing this blog post, I am in my third year of NUS, majoring in Computer Science.\\n\\n### Goals\\n\\n- Securing a 2022 Summer Internship at a [Good](/blog/good-company) company\\n- Overseas Exchange at University of California\\n- Securing job at a [Good](/blog/good-company) company (SV/SG)\\n\\nI had just received an offer to exchange at University of California, a dream come true, yet at the same time feeling uneasy."}]}')}}]);
